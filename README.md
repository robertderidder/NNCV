# 5LSM0: Neural Networks for Computer Vision

Welcome to the repository for **5LSM0: Neural Networks for Computer Vision**, from Robert de Ridder. This repository was cloned from  the [Video Coding & Architectures research group](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/signal-processing-systems/video-coding-architectures) and adapted for the final assignment. 

## Overview
This repository contains all the weekly notebooks and the final Assignment. For details and a README file about the Final Assignment, go the the folder "Final assignment". I would like to thank all the lecturers and the instructor for making this a fun and interesting course.
